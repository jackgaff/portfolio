            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Jack, a computer engineering student at the University of Michigan. I'm passionate about delving into the intricacies of low-level coding and computer architecture. Exploring the foundational aspects of computing has always intrigued me.</p>
            <p>My academic journey in computer engineering has been an immersive experience, where I've delved into subjects such as digital logic, microprocessors, and system design. I find joy in deciphering the complexities that govern the core functioning of computers and systems.</p>
            <p>Besides web development, I have many other hobbies and interests that keep me busy and happy. I love reading books, and watching all types of sports. I also enjoy playing golf, watching movies, listening to music, and traveling. Some of my favorite things are football, Star Wars, The Masters, 60s music, and the Fast and Furious franchise.</p>
            <p>My goal is to become a full-stack web developer and work on projects that can make a positive impact on the world. I am always looking for new opportunities and challenges that can help me grow as a web developer and as a person. If you are interested in working with me or learning more about me, please feel free to contact me using the form below or follow me on social media.</p>
